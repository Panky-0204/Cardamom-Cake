   Make one 9-inch square or round cake,or 12 large cupcakes/muffins


1. Preheat the oven to 350F (175C). 
2. Carefully smash the cradamoms open with a mortar and pestle (or any other heavy object such as a rolling pin or hammer).
3. Place the smashed cradamoms into the milk in a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes (do not boil).
4. Strain the cardamom milk.
5. In a large bowl, add the flour, eggs, butter, sugar, baking powder and salt.
6. Gently whisk everything together for a few minutes until you have a thick, smooth batter.
7. Slowly pour the cardamom milk into the batter and mix it well. 
8. Pour the cake batter into a well-greased cake pan or cupcake moulds (use melted buter to brush the pan/moulds) and bake for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown. Insert a toothpick or fork into the center of the cake to test if it's done; the toothpick/fork will come out clean.
